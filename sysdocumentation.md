### 5.6 Data Integrity & Constraints

#### Database Design
- PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase
- Tables structured around entity types (users, resources, requests, etc.)
- Foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity
- Timestamp fields for auditing and tracking changes
- Row-Level Security policies to control access

#### Data Validation
- Client-side validation using Zod schemas
- Server-side validation through database constraints
- Type checking using TypeScript

#### Constraints Implementation
- **NOT NULL** constraints for required fields
- **FOREIGN KEY** constraints to enforce relationships
- **DEFAULT** values for standardization
- **CHECK** constraints for field value validation
- **UNIQUE** constraints to prevent duplicates

#### Data Integrity Measures
- Transaction-based operations for multi-table updates
- Optimistic concurrency control
- Data validation at every layer (UI, service, database)
- Consistent error handling and reporting

### 5.7 Procedural Design

#### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Client-side validation ensures data format is correct
3. Credentials are sent to Supabase Auth API
4. Upon successful authentication, JWT token is stored
5. User profile is fetched based on authenticated user ID
6. Role-specific authorization is applied
7. User is redirected to role-specific dashboard
8. Session state is maintained and refreshed as needed

#### Service Request Flow
1. Beneficiary creates service request with details
2. Request validation ensures all required fields are present
3. Request is stored in the database with "pending" status
4. Staff is notified of new requests
5. Staff reviews and assigns the request
6. Status updates are recorded as request progresses
7. Beneficiary can track status through their dashboard
8. Upon completion, service history is updated

#### Resource Allocation Flow
1. Staff identifies resources needed for beneficiaries
2. Available resources are checked in the inventory
3. Allocation is created linking resources to beneficiaries
4. Resource quantities are updated accordingly
5. Beneficiary is notified of resource allocation
6. Allocation history is maintained for reporting

### 5.8 User Interface Design

#### Design System
- Consistent color scheme based on primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Typography hierarchy with distinct heading and body text styles
- Component library (Shadcn UI) for consistent UI elements
- Responsive design patterns for mobile, tablet, and desktop

#### Layout Structure
- Site-wide navigation with role-based access
- Dashboard layouts with overview cards and key metrics
- List views with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Detail views for records with actions
- Form interfaces for data entry with validation

#### Key UI Elements
- Role-based dashboards with relevant metrics
- Calendar interfaces for scheduling
- Resource management interfaces with allocation tools
- Service request forms with status tracking
- Report generation interfaces with filters

#### Design Principles
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Consistency: Uniform patterns and components
- Simplicity: Clear, uncluttered interfaces
- Responsiveness: Proper display across devices
- Feedback: Clear indication of system status
- Error handling: Helpful error messages

## 6. Program Code

The codebase is organized into several key areas:

### Frontend Structure
- `/src/pages`: Page components organized by user role
- `/src/components`: Reusable UI components and role-specific components
- `/src/services`: Service functions for API interactions
- `/src/contexts`: React context providers for state management
- `/src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for shared logic
- `/src/types`: TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/utils`: Utility functions and helpers
- `/src/lib`: Shared libraries and configurations
- `/src/integrations`: Integration code for external services

### Backend Structure
- Supabase tables and relationships
- Row-Level Security policies
- Edge Functions for custom serverless logic
- Database triggers for automation

### Key Components

#### Authentication System
```typescript
// src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx - Authentication context provider
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect, useContext } from "react";
import { supabase } from "@/integrations/supabase/client";
import { User } from "@/types/auth";
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";

// Authentication context providing user state and methods for login/logout
export const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType>({
  user: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  isLoading: true,
  login: async () => {},
  logout: async () => {},
  createUser: async () => {},
  updateUserProfile: async () => {},
  getAllUsers: async () => [],
  getUserById: async () => undefined,
});
```

#### Dashboard Components
```typescript
// src/pages/admin/Index.tsx - Admin dashboard component
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import SharedDashboardLayout from "@/components/layout/SharedDashboardLayout";
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { fetchAllUsers, fetchSystemStats } from "@/services/adminService";

// Admin dashboard with statistics, activity, and user management
const AdminDashboard = () => {
  // Dashboard implementation with metrics and charts
};
```

#### Service Management
```typescript
// src/services/serviceRequestService.ts - Service request handling
import { supabase } from "@/integrations/supabase/client";
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
import { ServiceRequest } from "@/types/staff";

// Functions for fetching, creating, and updating service requests
export async function fetchServiceRequests(): Promise<ServiceRequest[]> {
  // Implementation for fetching service requests from the database
}

export async function updateServiceRequest(id: string, request: Partial<ServiceRequest>): Promise<ServiceRequest | null> {
  // Implementation for updating service requests
}
```

## 7. Testing

### Unit Testing

#### Test Case Design
- Component rendering tests to verify UI elements
- Service function tests with mocked API responses
- Utility function tests for data transformation and validation
- Form validation tests using schema validators

#### Unit Test Coverage
- Authentication functions
- Form validation
- Service functions
- Utility functions
- Component rendering

#### Unit Test Implementation
```typescript
// Example test for a service function
import { fetchResources } from '@/services/resourceManagementService';
import { supabase } from '@/integrations/supabase/client';

jest.mock('@/integrations/supabase/client');

describe('Resource Management Service', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  test('fetchResources should return resources when successful', async () => {
    const mockResources = [{ id: 'abc', name: 'Test Resource' }];
    supabase.from.mockReturnValue({
      select: jest.fn().mockReturnValue({
        order: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: mockResources, error: null })
      })
    });

    const result = await fetchResources();
    expect(result).toEqual(mockResources);
    expect(supabase.from).toHaveBeenCalledWith('resources');
  });
});
```

## 9. Security Implementation

### Authentication Security
- JWT-based authentication through Supabase Auth
- Secure password hashing and storage (Argon2 via Supabase)
- Token refresh mechanism for session maintenance
- Automatic session timeout for inactive users
- Email verification for new accounts

### Authorization and Access Control
- Role-based access control for routes and components
- Row-Level Security policies in the database
- Frontend route guards to prevent unauthorized access
- Component-level access control based on user roles
- Permission-based UI rendering

### Data Security
- Input validation on all user-provided data
- Parameter sanitization for database queries
- HTTPS for all data transmission
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Data minimization principle applied

### API Security
- JWT verification for API access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Proper error handling to avoid information leakage
- Function-level permissions for Supabase Edge Functions
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS)

### Security Implementation Examples

#### Route Guard Component
```typescript
// Route guard for protected routes
const RouteGuard = ({ children, requiredRoles = [] }) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, user, isLoading } = useAuth();
  const location = useLocation();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" state={{ from: location }} replace />;
  }

  if (requiredRoles.length > 0 && !hasRequiredRole(user?.role, requiredRoles)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
  }

  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

#### Row-Level Security Policy
```sql
-- RLS policy example for service requests
CREATE POLICY "Staff can update service requests"
  ON public.service_requests
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'staff' OR auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin')
  );
```

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// Zod schema for service request validation
const serviceRequestSchema = z.object({
  service_type: z.string().min(1, "Service type is required"),
  description: z.string().min(10, "Description must be at least 10 characters"),
  urgency: z.enum(["low", "medium", "high"]),
  preferred_contact_method: z.string().optional(),
});
```

## 10. Limitations of the Project

### Technical Limitations
1. **Offline Functionality**: The application requires an internet connection and does not support offline mode, which can be problematic in areas with limited connectivity.
